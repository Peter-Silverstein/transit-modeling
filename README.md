# Transit Modeling in Seattle, WA
### Last updated: 12.05.2024

## Welcome to my Transit Modeling project!
This project is focusing on better understanding public transit in Seattle, Washington. Some pieces of it will eventually end up as my master's thesis project for the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia University.

## Current and future agenda
At present, I am focused on mapping variables associated with the [Puget Sound Regional Council](https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program) and ACS 2022 5-year estimates via [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/). In the near future, I'll be analyzing transit accessibility, reliability, and uncertainty in the city with real-time transit data from [OneBusAway](https://onebusaway.org).
