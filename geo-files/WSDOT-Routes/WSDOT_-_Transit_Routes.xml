            <abstract>This dataset provides information on fixed-route transit route lines for the State of Washington as of 8/14/23. Stop data was extracted from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. Because GTFS data is typically created and managed by each individual transit agency, WSDOT cannot guarantee the accuracy of these data.Most data points are provided direct from GTFS feeds according to the specification at https://gtfs.org/. The route_id field has been prepended with a code for each agency to ensure every route has a distinct route_id.Please send comments and questions to gtfs@wsdot.wa.gov</abstract>
